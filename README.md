# HurstExponentNotebooks

Here is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks detailing an exploration of the Hurst parameter. The Hurst parameter is a measure of memory in time-series data. Given recent
movement in the data how does that affect future movement? We can then classify a time-series as persistent, random, or anti-persistent. We may also want to see how such
classifications compare to other metrics such as the RSI or Beta. 

It is recommended that one use nbviewer.jupyter.org to render the latex in the python notebooks.
